Hello Sydney,

Thank you for sharing your introduction video. Your comfort level is commendable as it shows that you are at ease while communicating about yourself. This is a fantastic strength to have, especially in the dating scene where first impressions are significant. 

However, there are a few areas you could improve upon to make your communication even more effective. Firstly, your engagement level is relatively low. To increase this, you might want to consider sharing more about your interests, hobbies, or experiences that would make the conversation more interactive and engaging for your potential date. 

Secondly, the emotional expression you display is quite stable but leans towards the lower side, indicating a lack of enthusiasm or excitement. It's always a good idea to show some excitement about the prospect of meeting new individuals. This doesn't mean you should be overly exuberant, but a bit more enthusiasm can go a long way in making you seem more approachable and interesting.

Keep these tips in mind, and we're confident you'll do great. Happy dating!
