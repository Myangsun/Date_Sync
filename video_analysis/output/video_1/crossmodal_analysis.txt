Cross-Cultural Communication Tips: 

1. Respect personal space: Different cultures have different understandings of personal space. Try to maintain an appropriate distance during the conversation to make the other person feel comfortable.

2. Active Listening: Show interest in what the other person is saying, maintain eye contact, and provide appropriate feedback. This shows respect and attention to the speaker's words, regardless of their cultural background.

3. Avoid Assumptions: The fact that the person drove Uber over the weekend suggests they might be working multiple jobs or enjoy meeting new people. However, it's important to avoid making assumptions based on this information.

4. Be sensitive to non-verbal cues: Non-verbal cues like eye movement, facial expression, and tone of voice can give you important information about how the other person is feeling. Be aware and adapt your communication style if needed.

5. Be mindful of cultural differences: If you're aware that the person you're speaking with is from a different cultural background, be mindful of potential cultural differences. This can include differences in communication style, values, or social norms.
