Feedback:

1. Positivity: Your conversation seems to be quite neutral with a slight negative lean. This might be due to the story you chose to share about your Uber experience. While it's okay to share personal experiences, it's better to focus on positive or neutral stories, especially in the early stages of getting to know someone. Sharing a negative experience right away might create an unintentional negative atmosphere.

2. Engagement: Your engagement level is slightly lower than your comfort level. This could be due to the topics you're discussing. The story about your Uber experience might have been a bit intense for an initial conversation. Try to engage the other person with light-hearted and interesting topics.

3. Comfort: You seem to be relatively comfortable during the conversation. This is a good sign as it shows you are being genuine. However, keep in mind that comfort doesn't always translate to connection. Try to find common interests or topics that both of you can relate to, in order to increase the engagement level.

4. Storytelling: Your ability to tell a story is evident in your conversation. This is a great skill to have as it makes the interaction more enjoyable and engaging. However, remember to gauge the other person's response and adjust your storytelling accordingly. If they seem disinterested or uncomfortable, switch to a different topic.

In conclusion, focus more on positive or neutral stories, engage the other person with light-hearted and interesting topics, find common ground, and adapt your storytelling based on their responses.
