Your communication in the dating video was overall, relatively stable and comfortable, but there are a few areas that could use some work. Here are some tips and insights to help improve your dating communication:

1. Show More Emotion: Currently, your emotional expression appears to be somewhat neutral. While being calm and composed can be a good thing, showing a bit more emotion could make your conversation more engaging and relatable. Don't be afraid to express your feelings or show enthusiasm about a topic you're genuinely interested in.

2. Increase Engagement: Your engagement level was found to be quite low. This could be because the conversation was more about your own experiences and less about getting to know the other person. Try to ask more open-ended questions about the other person's interests, experiences, and aspirations to create a deeper connection.

3. Positive Spin: When sharing personal experiences, especially negative ones like your Uber incident, try to spin them in a more positive or humorous light. The story about your first day on the job could have been a great conversation starter, but the way it was presented might have led to a negative mood. 

4. Active Listening: Show that you are actively listening and interested in the other person's responses. A simple "That sounds interesting!" or "Tell me more about your family in Texas." could go a long way in making the other person feel valued and engaged in the conversation.

5. Comfort Level: Your comfort level was quite high, which is a great strength. This shows you're relaxed and at ease in dating situations. Continue to maintain this as it can make the other person feel more comfortable too. 

Remember, dating is not just about self-expression, but also about engaging the other person and building a connection.
