Feedback for Dating Video:

1. Emotion Expression:
Your emotional expression was fairly stable, indicating that you are a calm and composed individual. This is a significant strength as it shows potential partners that you can handle various situations without becoming overly emotional. However, the expression was somewhat neutral, lacking in either positive or negative emotions. This can make you appear uninterested or indifferent. 

Action Plan:
Try to express more positive emotions when talking about your life or experiences. For instance, when talking about your job, you could discuss the aspects you enjoy or the achievements you're proud of. This will make your conversations more engaging and appealing to potential partners.

2. Comfort Level:
You seemed to be reasonably comfortable during the video, which is a good sign because it shows you are open to the dating process. Your stability in this area also suggests you're not easily upset or disturbed, an attractive trait for potential partners. 

Action Plan:
To improve, try to be more relaxed and natural. You could achieve this by rehearsing what you want to say, or by imagining that you're talking to a good friend rather than a camera.

3. Engagement Level:
Your engagement level was comparatively lower, indicating you might not have been fully invested in the conversation. This could give the impression that you are disinterested, which could potentially discourage prospective partners.

Action Plan:
To enhance your engagement level, try to speak more enthusiastically about your interests and experiences. Use hand gestures and facial expressions to emphasize your points and show your excitement. Make sure to maintain eye contact, as this can significantly increase your engagement level.

Remember, the purpose of a dating video is to showcase your personality and interests to attract potential partners. Therefore, it's important to express positive emotions, be comfortable, and display high levels of engagement.
