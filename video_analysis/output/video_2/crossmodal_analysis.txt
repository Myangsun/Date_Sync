Overall, your emotional stability and comfort level suggest that you are generally comfortable and secure in yourself. This is a great strength when it comes to dating as it can create a sense of ease and trust with potential partners. 

However, your engagement level is a bit low. In the context of dating, this could make you come across as disinterested or unenthusiastic, which may discourage potential partners. Here are a couple of tips to improve this:

1. Show enthusiasm: When you're sharing stories or experiences, like talking about a new job, try to express your excitement or interest. This not only makes your story more engaging but also shows that you're passionate and capable of enthusiasm.

2. Ask questions: Show genuine interest in the other person. Ask about their experiences or opinions. This can make the conversation more interactive and engaging, and demonstrates that you're not just interested in talking about yourself.

3. Be more expressive: Use your facial expressions and body language to convey your emotions better. Smiling, nodding, and maintaining eye contact can make you seem more engaged and approachable.

Remember, dating is about building a connection. Showing genuine interest and enthusiasm can significantly improve your communication and make your interactions more enjoyable for both you and your potential partner.
