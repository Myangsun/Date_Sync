Cross-cultural communication tips:

1. Be aware of the person's comfort level. If they seem uncomfortable, try to create a more relaxed environment, perhaps by using humor or sharing a personal story.

2. Be patient and allow them to speak at their own pace. Their discomfort might cause them to speak slower or take more pauses.

3. Use non-verbal cues to show empathy and understanding. This can help build rapport and make the person feel more comfortable.

4. Be mindful of potential cultural differences that could affect the person's comfort level and emotional state. For instance, in some cultures, it's common to speak indirectly or use more formal language in professional settings.

5. Lastly, maintain eye contact as it is a universal sign of attentiveness and respect. However, be aware that the level of direct eye contact considered appropriate can vary between cultures.
