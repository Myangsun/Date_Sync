Hi Daryl. Hi. How are you? Good. How was your weekend? Good. Nothing too crazy. I was actually in Texas visiting family. So yeah, happy to be back. How about you? Did you have a good weekend? Yeah, I did. I was this weekend I was doing Uber. I was driving Uber this weekend. So I had to, it's a very long story, but the passenger, when I told him to leave my car, but he won't leave, so I had to call the police and everything. Oh no. Yeah. Oh, how long have you been Ubering for? It was my first day. Oh. Eventful first day. My account is on hold now even. So I don't know what will happen, but it was okay other than that. Okay, good. Good to hear.
