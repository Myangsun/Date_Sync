The interpretation of these nonverbal signals can greatly vary across cultures. For instance, pitch and intensity of voice are often associated with emotional states, and these associations may differ across cultures. A high pitched voice might be seen as expressive and enthusiastic in Western cultures, but could be interpreted as lack of control or overexcitement in some Eastern cultures. Similarly, eye movement could indicate various things, from confidence to nervousness, and this is highly dependent on cultural norms. The comfort level indicator could be associated with body language, which is another important aspect of nonverbal communication that is interpreted differently across cultures.

As for suggestions for improvement, Sydney could benefit from learning about the specific nonverbal cues that are considered respectful and appropriate in the culture of the person she is communicating with. For example, in some cultures, maintaining eye contact is seen as a sign of respect and attentiveness, while in others it can be viewed as confrontational or disrespectful. Sydney might also want to moderate the pitch and intensity of her voice to match the norms of the other person's culture, to avoid potential misinterpretations. Furthermore, she could work on her comfort level as it might be affecting her body language, possibly making her appear less confident or approachable. This could involve techniques to reduce anxiety, such as deep breathing or visualization exercises.
